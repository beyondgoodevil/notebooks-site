# Artificial Intelligence

Notes on AI — history, methods, and open problems.

## A Brief History

- **1950s–60s**: Logic-based AI, general problem solvers, early optimism
- **1970s–80s**: Expert systems; the first "AI winter" after overselling
- **1980s–90s**: Machine learning rises; neural nets have a resurgence
- **2010s**: Deep learning achieves dramatic results on perception tasks
- **2020s**: Large language models, foundation models, the current boom

## What Works

Deep learning has transformed: image recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, protein structure prediction (AlphaFold), game playing (Go, chess), and increasingly general-purpose language tasks.

## What Remains Hard

- Reliable reasoning and planning over long horizons
- Robust generalization outside the training distribution
- Learning efficiently from small amounts of data
- Understanding *why* a system produced an output
- Avoiding confident-sounding wrong answers

## Open Questions

Is scaling sufficient? Current trends suggest that larger models trained on more data continue to improve on benchmarks, but it's unclear whether this continues indefinitely or whether qualitatively new capabilities require new approaches.
