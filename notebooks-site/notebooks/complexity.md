# Complexity (and/or "Complex Systems")

What makes systems "complex"? A grab-bag of ideas from various fields.

## Candidate Definitions

Complexity is one of those words that everyone uses but nobody defines consistently. Some candidates:

- **Computational complexity**: how hard is it to *describe* or *simulate* the system?
- **Statistical complexity**: the amount of information needed to optimally predict future behavior (Crutchfield's ε-machine complexity)
- **Logical depth** (Bennett): the time needed to compute the object from its shortest description
- **Effective complexity** (Gell-Mann): length of the shortest description of the system's regularities

These are all different and capture different intuitions.

## Common Themes in "Complex Systems"

- Emergence: macro-level properties not obvious from micro-level rules
- Self-organization: ordered patterns arising without central control
- Nonlinearity: outputs not proportional to inputs; sensitivity to initial conditions
- Feedback: outputs feed back to influence inputs

## Santa Fe Institute Program

The SFI complex systems program (from the 1980s onward) brought together physicists, biologists, economists, and computer scientists to study common patterns across systems. Important work on: adaptive agents, cellular automata, NK landscapes, spin glasses, and much else.

Some of it has held up well; some was over-hyped.
