# Probability Theory

Measure-theoretic probability and its foundations.

## Key Texts

- Billingsley, P. *Probability and Measure* (3rd ed.) — the standard graduate text
- Durrett, R. *Probability: Theory and Examples* — excellent for limit theorems
- Kallenberg, O. *Foundations of Modern Probability* — comprehensive and rigorous

## Foundations

Kolmogorov's axiomatization: a probability space (Ω, ℱ, P) consists of a sample space, a σ-algebra of events, and a probability measure. The σ-algebra requirement is what forces us into measure theory — we need to be careful about which sets are "measurable."

## Limit Theorems

The law of large numbers and central limit theorem are the workhorses of applied probability. Less appreciated: the rate of convergence, the Berry-Esseen theorem, and situations where the CLT *fails* (heavy tails, dependence).

## Random Processes

- Martingales: the right framework for sequences with "no exploitable structure"
- Markov chains: memoryless processes, spectral gaps, mixing times
- Brownian motion: the continuous limit of random walks, foundational for stochastic calculus
