# Cognitive Science

An interdisciplinary field studying mind and intelligence.

## The Core Disciplines

Cognitive science draws on: psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy of mind, computer science (AI), and anthropology. The unifying question: what is the nature of mental representation and computation?

## Debates

### Symbols vs. Subsymbols

Classical cognitive science (Fodor, Pylyshyn) posits a "language of thought" — mental representations are symbolic, discrete, combinatorially structured. Connectionist approaches (Rumelhart, McClelland) posit that cognition emerges from patterns of activation in neural networks, without explicit symbols.

The debate remains unresolved, though most researchers now think both levels of description are useful.

### Embodied/Situated Cognition

The cognitivist mainstream treats cognition as computation over internal representations, abstracted away from the body and environment. The embodied cognition movement (Varela, Thompson, Rosch; Brooks; Chemero) argues that mind is constitutively shaped by having a body and acting in the world.

### Modularity

Fodor argued that peripheral systems (perception, language) are *modular* — fast, domain-specific, encapsulated from other knowledge — while central cognition is not. How much of cognition is modular is an empirical question.
